# Types of Intelligent agents

    Problem-solving agents -They do many traditional planning expert systems did, namely collect data, analyze a situation, 
    and make a conforming decision for how to act on the user’s behalf. Purchasing agents is an example for this category.
    
    User-centric agents- These type of agents enable interaction with the user. Also they provide a better user interface 
    by getting knowledge about the user’s system use preferences and tailoring the interface to the user preferences.
    
    Control agents – They control the operation of some agents in a multi agent environment. In this context one needs to 
    remember that agents are not only mobile, but also small in size, each with a very specialized capability. Hence, the 
    interaction of several agents might be required to provide sufficient intelligence and capability. These are very 
    progressive agents used in research experimentations.
    
    Transaction agents- These agents translate information between different data standards within a unrelated database or
    file environment.
    
    Between these four types, the ones that create contention are problem solving agents specializing in data gathering.
    They may be aided by transaction agents to access data from numerous data sources and may be controlled by control 
    agents. However, the most important functionality is the ability to collect and analyze information from remote sites.
